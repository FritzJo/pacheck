# Pacheck (WIP)
Combination of the name _pacman_ and _check_ :-)

This tool checks installed Arch packages for known vulnerabilities. The data is collected from the amazing [Arch security dashboard](https://security.archlinux.org/) and matched against all currently installed packages.

My goal is to provide an alternative to the existing tool [arch-audit](https://github.com/ilpianista/arch-audit)
